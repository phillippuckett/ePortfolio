    <p class="aboutMeText">Hey my name is Phillip, I am a Software Developer by trade and a Salt Lake County native. I enjoy exercising, the outdoors, community involvement, and gardening. I am highly
        energetic, charismatic, and like exploring my talents and creativity.</p>
    <!--<p class="aboutMeText">
        Hey there! My name is Phillip (or Phil, or whatever creative liberty you choose to take). I am a Salt Lake City native who
        enjoys exercise, the outdoors, and I even have garden where I grow foods, herbs and spices for my family. I am highly
        energetic, charismatic, and like exploring my talents and creativity.
        Though I suppose the more relevant part of my life began back in 2010 where after spending a couple of years as a volunteer helping people in Brazil, 
        I returned home to Salt Lake City where I attended Salt Lake Community College and earned a degree in Associated Sciences.

    <!--<p class="aboutMeText">
        While attending the college I found myself becoming actively involved with the school as well as within the community, immersing
        myself in a number of volunteer opportunities. I served the student body as a Senator, an Executive Assistant to
        the President, and ultimately Regional Chair - a position I had obtained as a candidate for Regional Vice Presidency.
        During the Summer of 2015, and about halfway through my transfer program for a bachelors in Food Science at Utah State University, I jumped ship to become a software developer.

    <!--<p class="aboutMeText">
        In the U.S. Marine Corps they have a saying, "Adapt and overcome."
        Despite not ever having been a marine I've taken this saying into my life to mean that there is always a way to move forward and to progress, but it is up to me to remember that and in the process to maintain
        a positive mental outlook so that I can find it. As one who believes in the power of my own choices I feel accountable
        for the outcome of my actions, as Gœthe once said, “I am the decisive element”, and with that I choose to live my life looking forward to whatever life brings my way.

Hey there, my name is Phillip (or Phil, or whatever creative liberty you choose to take) and I am going to share with you
some of what makes me who I am. I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah and as you may consequently suspect I enjoy
rock-climbing, trail running, skiing, river rafting, boating, obstacle coursing, weight training, yoga, and pick-up sports.
Although I am enamored with living an active lifestyle, I am also a strong advocate for balance. As a native of Utah,
I have come to appreciate nature to a profound extent; as a result gardening has become one of my favorite pass-times. 
I grow food and herbs for my family, and me and the hobby affords me time to meditate, and unwind without the aide of substances. 
The poise has allowed me to develop my ability to consistently be highly energetic, charismatic, and to explore my creativity. 
Well that's enough about me as a person, let’s dive into more pertinent information.

I suppose the more relevant part of my life began back in 2010, when I returned to the United States after spending a couple of years helping people in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Shortly after coming back home to Salt Lake City, Utah I began attending SLCC (Salt Lake Community College), where I earned a degree in Associated Sciences. While attending SLCC I found myself becoming actively involved with the school as well as within my community - immersing myself in a number of volunteer opportunities. By the time I obtained my Associates degree I had actively served the student body as a Senator, Executive Assistant to the President, and ultimately Regional Chair - a position I had obtained as a candidate for Regional Vice Presidency. These leadership experiences taught me the value and importance of effective communication and organization in a professional environment -though I feel these skills apply in every walk of life.

After getting about halfway through my bachelors degree in Nutrition and Food Science a friend of mine introduced me to the world of software development. It was almost immediately that I began researching places to learn code, and after dabbling a little in codecademy I found myself applying for a local software boot camp by the name of DevMountain where I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript and MEAN-stack development. There I was able to put into practice the technologies taught to me, and further grow and develop my talents as a web developer. As strange as it may seem switching over from sunlight-athleticism and health science, to cave-dwelling and web-development was not so much of a shock culturally as it was cerebrally. Needless to say that initially my synapses weren't too happy about the switch, but I knew that it was merely a matter of acclimatizing to the new environment.

One of the more important lessons taught to me in life was brought to me by two of my brothers who served in the USMC. They have a saying in the core that encapsulates a simple yet very powerful mindset, "Adapt and overcome." This phrase is something that has helped in always reminding me that I have the power within myself to accomplish what I set out to accomplish. There’s always a way to move forward and to progress, but it is up to me to remember that and in the process to maintain a positive mental outlook so that I can find it. As one who believes in will power I feel that I am the one accountable for the outcome of my actions, and as a result am dedicated to fulfilling my responsibilities to ensure that I am proud of the actions I choose to make. As Gœthe
 once said, “I am the decisive element”.
